Decks of flashcards for the https://apps.ankiweb.net application that can be used to memorize Pokémon type matchups and effectiveness.

---

**Decklist**:
- `Monotype Matchups`
	- A deck for testing your knowledge. One card for every monotype matchup (i.e. 'grass attacking water' and 'fire attacking rock').
- `Type Effectiveness`
  - A deck for initially memorizing type effectiveness—each type's resistances, weaknesses, strengths, etc. Each type has separate cards for the different ways it interacts with other types (i.e. there are five cards for fighting-type: 'not effective against,' 'not very effective against,' 'super effective against,' 'resistant to,' and 'weak to').
